# diseeapp

In this project I learned a new datatype in dart called dynamic and understand what is anonymous function.
using 'var' as variable without initialzing its value will make it dynamic datatype
Added an Expanded Widget, use the more concise function for calling image asset with Image.asset
Added Stateful widget and used setState,
Practiced the use of function and refactor some code eg( \_randomLeftDice and \_randomLeftRight ).
Imported a library Dart Math and use the Random class to get a Random Int number.
